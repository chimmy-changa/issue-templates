        ```bash
        $ python ./troubleshooting/troubleshooting.py
        ```

        If logging is enabled for `matlab-proxy` using the `MWI_LOG_FILE` environment variable, we recommend
        that you also enable it when executing the troubleshooting script:
         ```bash
        $ MWI_LOG_FILE="/tmp/log.file" python ./troubleshooting/troubleshooting.py
        ```
